## Concept
The concept of a *radio* is quite simple, a song plays and everyone connected to that radio can hear the music being played.

Once logged into Spotify (premium account is required) you can create your own radio, join a public one or join a private one through a shared link.

A radio can be *public*, *colaborative* and/or *anonymous*:
- Public radios will be published in the main page which can be seen by everyone.
- In colaborative radios anyone will be able to add songs to the queue, if not selected the radio owner will be the only one capable of doing so.
- Anonymous radios don not show the owner's username in the radio page.

The radio page also provides a chat to speak with other people connected to the same radio.
